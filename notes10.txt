Block Elements:
=> these elements take up the full width available
=> starts with a new line and push following content to the next line

e.g
<div>, <h1>, <p>








Inline Elements:
==> these elements only take up as much width as necessary
==> Do not start on a new line
--> allowing other elements to sit next to them on the same line

<span>, <a>, <img>, <b>
