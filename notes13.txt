
HTML entities:

HTML entities are special codes
used to represents characters or symbols that have special meaning in HTML

e.g
if you want to display '<', '>' etc. characters on a webpage as a text, you can't just use them directly, because browswer would interpret them as HTML code

so that we use entities for that
